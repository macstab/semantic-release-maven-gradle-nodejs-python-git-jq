# Chapter 1: Introduction to the Docker Image

## Purpose and General Description

The Docker image serves as a foundational platform for projects utilizing semantic-release for automated version management and releases. This image is specifically tailored to support various programming environments, including JavaScript, Java (with Maven and Gradle), and Python, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of development and release tasks.

## Base Image and its Significance

The base image, `macstab/node-python-git-jq-bookworm:latest`, is a meticulously chosen image that combines Node.js, Python, Git, and JQ on a Debian Bookworm distribution. This blend is particularly beneficial for projects that necessitate the use of multiple programming languages and tools throughout their build and release process. The choice of this base image underscores the image's flexibility and readiness to handle diverse development requirements.

## Custom Configurations and Environment Variables

One of the key features of this Docker image is its support for custom configurations through the environment variable `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_CONFIG`. This allows for various project environments to be easily managed and configured. The image supports several predefined configurations, specifically tailored for different environments such as JavaScript, Maven, and Python.

These configurations are accessible and modifiable, providing users with the flexibility to adapt the image to their specific project needs. This capability significantly simplifies the process of setting up and managing project-specific release workflows.

# Chapter 6: Utilizing Predefined Semantic-Release Profiles

This chapter explains how to use the four predefined Semantic-Release configurations for Gradle, Maven, JavaScript, and Python projects. The configurations can be controlled by either setting an environment variable or using command-line arguments in the Docker image.

## Selecting Configurations

There are two primary ways to select a specific Semantic-Release configuration:

1. **Environment Variable**: Set the `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_CONFIG` environment variable in the Docker image. The default is `/configs/.releaserc-js.json`.
2. **Command Line Argument**: Use the `--config` argument with the Semantic-Release executable from the Docker image. For example, `semantic-release --config /configs/.releaserc-gradle.json`.

## Profile Overviews and Implementation

Each profile is tailored to suit the specific needs of different development environments. Let's delve into what each profile does and how to implement them.

### Gradle Profile

- **Overview**: This profile is configured for projects using Gradle. It includes rules and plugins suited for managing and releasing Java applications built with Gradle.
- **Key Features**: Commit message analysis, changelog generation, version management tailored for Gradle.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```dockerfile
    SEMANTIC_RELEASE_CONFIG=/configs/.releaserc-gradle.json semantic-release
  ```

### Maven Profile

- **Overview**: Tailored for Maven projects, this profile automates versioning and releasing in the Maven ecosystem.
- **Key Features**: Integration with Maven's lifecycle, commit analysis, and Maven-specific release processes.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```shell
    semantic-release --config /configs/.releaserc-maven.json
  ```


### JavaScript Profile

- **Overview**: Designed for JavaScript-based projects, especially those managed with npm or yarn.
- **Key Features**: NPM publishing, commit message analysis, and automated release notes generation.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```shell
    docker run -e SEMANTIC_RELEASE_CONFIG=/configs/.releaserc-js.json your-docker-image semantic-release
  ```


### Python Profile

- **Overview**: Configured for Python projects, particularly those using Poetry for package management.
- **Key Features**: Supports Python package versioning, PyPI publishing, and Python-specific release workflows.
